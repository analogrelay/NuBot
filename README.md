# FAQs

## How do I use it?
I dunno. I just write the thing. You figure it out.

But seriously, your starting point is going to be running the NuBot.exe app with a config JSON file. And I'm happy to help on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/anurse) or [Email](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01cx3FM0GGSrmhoAgDqbIs0A==&c=lDo5a6vLkj1EFc8D4dGBpsGo1mx9mrqRwaxvQcB2yFw=)

## But HuBot already exists...
Yeah, I know. The thing is:

1. NodeJS just ain't my bag, baby.
2. I thought it would be fun
3. JabbR (the chat system it uses) has a much better .NET client story than NodeJS.
3. Maybe I could do some things better?
